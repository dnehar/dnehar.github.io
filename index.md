I received my Ph.D. in Immunology from Sorbone University (Paris) under the mentorship of Prof. David Klatzmann. I completed my postocdoral fellowship at [The Jackson laboratory for Genomic Medecine] (CT, USA) under the mentorship of Prof. Jacques Banchereau.

My ongoing research within the [Verhaak lab] focuses on analyzing the tumor immune microenvironment in brain tumors, using single cell  and spatial transcriptomic approaches
