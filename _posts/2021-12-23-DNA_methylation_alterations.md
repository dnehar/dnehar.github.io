### Project 
To assess the similarities and differences between early pregnancy and tumor development in humans, I established a collaboration with Aryee lab (Massachusetts 
General Hospital & Harvard Medical School). 
In this study, we conducted a genome-wide comparison of DNA methylation changes in placental tissues during pregnancy and in 13 types of tumor tissues during the 
neoplastic transformation. We showed that the early pregnancy human placenta shares the patterns of DNA hypomethylation as seen in tumors.
