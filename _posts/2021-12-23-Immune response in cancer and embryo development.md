 My early research focused on the study of immune responses in both tumor and maternal-fetal microenvironments. 
 Using systems immunology approach, I was able to demonstrate that the early immune responses to cancer and to embryo development are similar and orchestrated by a specific CD4+ T cell population called the regulatory T cells (Tregs).![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22060632/147291040-b43bb7b7-2654-4fe1-a985-464a640dfc87.png)
