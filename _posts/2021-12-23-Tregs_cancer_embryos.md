### Project

My early research focused on the study of immune responses in both tumor and maternal-fetal microenvironments. 
Using systems immunology approach, I was able to demonstrate that the early immune responses to cancer and to embryo development are similar and orchestrated by
specific CD4+ T cell population called the regulatory T cells (Tregs).
