### Background 

Over the past 14 years, I have gained multi-disciplinary training in cancer immunology, autoimmunity, immune aging, early life immunity, and computational biology. My current research employs systems immunology approaches to investigate immune remodeling across the human lifespan. 

### The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine | Farmington, CT, USA
Research Scientist | 2023 - now (Ucar lab) <br>
Associate Research Scientist | 2019 - 2023 (Banchereau lab, then Verhaak lab)  <br>
Postdoctoral associate | 2016 - 2019 (Banchereau lab) <br>

Throughout my career at the Jackson lab, I have successfully led collaborative studies and developed computational frameworks to analyze genomic datasets, including single-cell (scRNA-seq), ATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptomics. My primary projects include: <br>
**1) Pediatric SLE patient classification through single-cell derived genomic signatures**. I developed computational pipelines using bulk and scRNA-seq to analyze large-scale datasets and enhance the accuracy of SLE patient classification. <br>
**2) NK-like senescent CD8+ T cells that expand with age**. I built computational frameworks to profile age-related immune senescence. <br>
**3) Longitudinal evaluation of the immune response to the first set of routine vaccines in infants**. I contributed significantly to the creation of computational models for studying immune cell dynamics in two-month-old infants. <br>
**4) Characterization of the immune perturbations in two-month-old infants with severe COVID-19**. I leveraged scRNA-seq, cytokine profiling, and antibody analysis to develop and automated a multi-omic computational framework for studying COVID-19 in infants and compare their immune responses to those of infected children and adults. <br>

### Ph.D. work - Early research: Klatzmann lab (Paris, France)

During my predoctoral training ([Klatzmann lab]; University Pierre & Marie Curie, Paris, France; 2010-2016), I focused on understanding why embryos and tumors expressing foreign antigens were not rejected by the immune system. Using murine models (pregnant mice and mice injected with different tumor models), I demonstrated that a specific CD4+ T cell population, the regulatory T cells (Tregs), orchestrates similar immune evasion mechanisms in both fetuses and tumors. Using both transcriptomic profiling and flow cytometry analysis of the tumor microenvironment, we demonstrated that co-silencing of TGF-Î² and VEGF led to a substantial spontaneous tumor eradication rate and the combination of their respective inhibitory drugs was synergistic.  A collaboration with the Aryee lab (Massachusetts General Hospital & Harvard Medical School) allowed us to confirm our findings on the similarities between tumor and fetal development in humans.
